    "text": "I’m a proteomics researcher with a background in mass spectrometry, structural biology, and computational analysis. I completed my Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the University of Victoria, where I spent several years at the UVic Genome BC Proteomics Centre developing and applying mass spectrometry–based structural proteomics methods. My work there spanned cross-linking mass spectrometry, HDX, and the characterization of protein structure, dynamics, and interactions in systems ranging from bacteria and mitochondria to prions, viral and intrinsically disordered proteins.\nAlong the way, I became deeply involved in the computational side of proteomics—building analytical workflows, writing software, and creating ways to extract more interpretable information from increasingly complex datasets. What started as a practical necessity gradually became a major part of how I think about scientific problems.\nI’m currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University, where my focus has expanded into quantitative and clinical proteomics. Much of my recent work involves DIA-based analysis, label-free quantification, proteoform-level interpretation, and developing reproducible pipelines for large-scale biological and clinical studies. This has included analyzing human cerebrospinal fluid, characterizing the proteomic consequences of oncogenic splicing factor mutations, and exploring protein network changes in cancer and neurodegenerative disease. These projects have given me a broader multiomic perspective, including experience in proteogenomics and variant-aware proteomic analysis.\nI enjoy working at the intersection of experimental proteomics, computation, and method development—whether that involves designing cross-linking strategies, refining DIA workflows, or building R packages to make complex analyses easier to reproduce and understand. My long-term aim is simple: to push proteomics toward deeper, more structurally informed, and more biologically meaningful measurements.\n\n\n😄"

    "section": "How Proteins Are Modified Before, During and After Translation",
    "text": "How Proteins Are Modified Before, During and After Translation\nProteins are the workhorses of the cell, performing a variety of functions such as catalysis, signaling, transport, and structure. However, proteins are not always ready to function right after they are synthesized by the ribosome. They often undergo different types of modifications that can affect their activity, stability, interactions, and localization. In this blog post, we will explore some of the common types of protein modifications and how they are regulated.\n\nPre-translational modification\nPre-translational modification is not a common term, but it could refer to the modifications that occur to the pre-mRNA molecule before it becomes a mature mRNA that can be translated. These include splicing, capping, and addition of a poly-A tail, all of which can potentially be regulated.\nSplicing is the process of removing the non-coding introns from the pre-mRNA and joining the coding exons together. This can result in different combinations of exons being included or excluded from the final mRNA, leading to alternative splicing. Alternative splicing can generate different protein isoforms with different functions or interactions.\nCapping is the process of adding a modified guanine nucleotide to the 5’ end of the pre-mRNA. This cap protects the mRNA from degradation and facilitates its transport out of the nucleus and its recognition by the ribosome.\nAdding a poly-A tail is the process of adding a long string of adenine nucleotides to the 3’ end of the pre-mRNA. This tail also protects the mRNA from degradation and enhances its translation efficiency.\nAnother possible meaning of pre-translational modification is the regulation of the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs) that control the transport of proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These signals are short amino acid sequences that are recognized by specific transport proteins called karyopherins or importins/exportins.\nNLSs and NESs can be regulated by alternative transcription/translation initiation, alternative translation termination, alternative splicing, and frameshift. These mechanisms can create or remove NLSs or NESs from a protein, affecting its subcellular localization and function.\n\n\nPost-translational modification\nPost-translational modification is the covalent process of changing proteins after they are synthesized by the ribosome. These changes can affect the protein’s structure, stability, activity, and interactions . There are more than a hundred types of post-translational modifications known, but some of the most common ones are:\n● **Phosphorylation**: The addition of a phosphate group to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues by kinases. This can activate or deactivate a protein or change its interactions with other proteins or molecules.\n● **Acetylation**: The addition of an acetyl group to lysine residues by acetyltransferases. This can affect the protein’s charge, stability, interactions, and localization.\n● **Methylation**: The addition of one or more methyl groups to lysine or arginine residues by methyltransferases. This can affect the protein’s charge, stability, interactions, and localization.\n● **Ubiquitination**: The addition of one or more ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues by ubiquitin ligases. This can mark a protein for degradation by the proteasome or alter its interactions or localization.\n● **Sumoylation**: The addition of one or more SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) molecules to lysine residues by SUMO ligases. This can affect the protein’s stability, interactions, localization, or activity.\n● **Glycosylation**: The addition of one or more sugar molecules to asparagine, serine, or threonine residues by glycosyltransferases. This can affect the protein’s folding, stability, interactions, localization, or recognition.\nPost-translational modifications can be reversible or irreversible, depending on the availability and activity of enzymes that can remove them. For example, phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatases, acetylation by deacetylases, methylation by demethylases, ubiquitination by deubiquitinases, sumoylation by desumoylases, and glycosylation by glycosidases.\nPost-translational modifications can also occur in different cellular compartments or locations. For example, some proteins are modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the Golgi apparatus before they are transported to other organelles or the plasma membrane. Some proteins are modified in the cytoplasm before they are imported into the nucleus or the mitochondria. Some proteins are modified in the extracellular space after they are secreted from the cell.\nTherefore, the term “post-translational” is needed to specify the timing and nature of the modification.\n\n\nConclusion\nProtein modifications are essential for the regulation of protein function and diversity. They can occur at different stages of protein synthesis and processing, from pre-translational to post-translational. They can also occur in different cellular locations and environments, from intracellular to extracellular. Understanding how protein modifications are regulated and how they affect protein function is crucial for understanding many biological processes and diseases."
