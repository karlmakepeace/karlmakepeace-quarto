# Hello!

I am a biochemist specializing in mass spectrometry, proteomics, and bioinformatics. My passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge technologies and approaches to explore diverse protein systems and devise innovative research methods that integrate these techniques.

Throughout my career, I have accumulated a wealth of experience as a proteomics research technician and later as a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Victoria Genome British Columbia Proteomics Centre](https://www.proteincentre.com/). During this time, I have conducted numerous structural proteomics experiments for both internal and external research projects, and have collaborated with colleagues to develop novel technologies and methods. Our efforts have significantly contributed to multiple [publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=W0-D1aYAAAAJ) in peer-reviewed journals. 

In my most recent role I gained experience in the emerging field of proteogenomics, which combines proteomics and genomics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of protein expression and (dys)function. As someone with a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies, I am thrilled to be expanding my expertise in this exciting area of research.

My goal is to use my expertise in these advanced technologies and methodologies to push the boundaries of our understanding of protein systems. I am excited about creating innovative research methods that can help us unravel the complexities of these systems and pave the way for future breakthroughs.
