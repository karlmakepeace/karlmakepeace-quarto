# Hello!

I am originally from the British Columbia.

As a biochemist with expertise in mass spectrometry, proteomics, and bioinformatics, I am keen on leveraging these cutting-edge technologies and approaches to explore diverse protein systems and devise innovative research methods that integrate these techniques.

Throughout my time as a proteomics research technician and later as a Ph.D. student at the University of Victoria Genome British Columbia Proteomics Centre, I accumulated a wealth of experience in conducting structural proteomics experiments for both internal and external research projects. Additionally, I collaborated with colleagues to develop novel technologies and methods, which significantly contributed to multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals.

As a biochemist with expertise in (structural) mass spectrometry, proteo(genom)ics, and bioinformatics, I am actively seeking career opportunities that allow me to apply my unique skillset in industry or academic settings.
