I’m a proteomics researcher with a background in mass spectrometry, structural biology, and computational analysis. I completed my Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the University of Victoria, where I spent several years at the UVic Genome BC Proteomics Centre developing and applying mass spectrometry–based structural proteomics methods. My work there spanned cross-linking mass spectrometry, HDX, and the characterization of protein structure, dynamics, and interactions in systems ranging from bacteria and mitochondria to prions, viral and intrinsically disordered proteins.

Along the way, I became deeply involved in the computational side of proteomics—building analytical workflows, writing software, and creating ways to extract more interpretable information from increasingly complex datasets. What started as a practical necessity gradually became a major part of how I think about scientific problems.

I’m currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University, where my focus has expanded into quantitative and clinical proteomics. Much of my recent work involves DIA-based analysis, label-free quantification, proteoform-level interpretation, and developing reproducible pipelines for large-scale biological and clinical studies. This has included analyzing human cerebrospinal fluid, characterizing the proteomic consequences of oncogenic splicing factor mutations, and exploring protein network changes in cancer and neurodegenerative disease. These projects have given me a broader multiomic perspective, including experience in proteogenomics and variant-aware proteomic analysis.

I enjoy working at the intersection of experimental proteomics, computation, and method development—whether that involves designing cross-linking strategies, refining DIA workflows, or building R packages to make complex analyses easier to reproduce and understand. My long-term aim is simple: to push proteomics toward deeper, more structurally informed, and more biologically meaningful measurements.
