## Karl A. T. Makepeace, Ph.D.

<!-- > To ask what others have not is the surest path to advantage. -->

<!-- ## Purpose of this Personal Website -->

<!-- The primary purpose of this site is to provide a stable and consistent "home base" on the web that's solely under my control and anyone can visit (no logins needed!). -->

<!-- ### Motivation(s) -->

<!-- Initially motivated by [Posit](https://posit.co/) (formerly [RStudio](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-is-now-posit/)) recently ([July 2022](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-quarto-a-new-scientific-and-technical-publishing-system/)) releasing [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (and moving on from `rmarkdown`). Getting the personal webpage up-and-running was a good way to play around with the new system. Also, it's simple enough to (hopefully) keep up with + maintain the site. -->

<!-- It allows me to: -->

<!-- -   showcase myself -->

<!-- -   share my research and other interests -->

<!-- -   develop my thoughts on various topics -->

<!-- -   link to me elsewhere on the web -->

[More about me ➡️](about.qmd){id='haiku'}


<!-- With a background in mass spectrometry, structural proteomics, and bioinformatics, my focus lies in synergizing these disciplines. This convergence not only enhances our comprehension of biological phenomena but also lays the groundwork for innovative technologies, advanced analytical methods, and the potential for novel therapeutic breakthroughs. -->
